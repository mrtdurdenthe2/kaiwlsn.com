> Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.

> So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don't quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it's no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities."

If theres one thing you should have an assumption about, its that technology will always improve. Especially AI

Hard descisions lead to good times. Easy descisions lead to bad times.
Try to do the hardest things you can.

Do things how you want to do them, and do most importantly do things that you enjoy.
Every time someone is successful or well renowned in a field, it is because they understood it in a way nobody else did (because they enjoyed it so much), and because they did things the they wanted to do them.

Don't let the advancement of AI demoralise you from whatever you're doing
